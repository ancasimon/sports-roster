# Sports Roster
[SportsRoster](https://sportsroster-76450.web.app)

## Description
This project is an exploration into coding CRUD functions (create, read, update, delete) in a React project, while using a Firebase database for user authentication and data management. Project instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/exercise-vault/blob/master/REACT_sports_roster.md).

## Background
Steaua of the later '80s and early '90s is the amazing soccer team I grew up with. These names - Hagi, Belodedici, Piturca, Lacatus, etc. - are engraved deeply in my childhood recollections. As I read them, my memory instantly overlays a TV announcer's voice with a step-by-step analysis of their play in a given match. And images of my father intently watching and discussing the plays afterwards. And sounds of "Goooooal" pouring out of hundreds of balconies with open windows, uncoordinated yet simultaneous, as soon as one of these players made history.
